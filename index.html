                <p>While laying down, closing your eyes. Focus on your breathing and create an 
                awareness within your body of where your awareness is. Bring your 
                awareness to your brain if isn't there already. Become aware of what you are
                seeing in your 3rd eye. What are you wanting to express? Embracing the 
                feeling that arises within you, begin to feel confident with your desires. 
                Knowing you can pursue them with passion. Now ground this feeling within 
                you as a true foundation of reality.</p>
